		<h1>The different stages</h1>
		<h1>⸻</h1><br><br><br>
		<p>Buying a property in Portugal is a straightforward commercial transaction.</p><br>
		<p>Once you have chosen the property you want, it is advisable to choose a qualified lawyer to represent you.</p><br>
		<p>This is usually a two-stage contract:</p><br><br><br>
		<h3>Promise Contract</h3>
		<p>⸻</p><br>
		<p>The buyer's legal representative will draw up a so-called promise to purchase contract (<i>contracto promessa de compra e venda</i>) to be signed by the buyer and the seller. This includes all the relevant details of the property, the price, the form of payment and any special conditions agreed by both parties.</p><br>
		<p>At this stage, the agreed deposit, normally 10% of the purchase price, is paid to the seller. The buyer and seller are then legally bound by the contract. There will be penalty clauses contained in this document in the event of either party withdrawing from the sale or purchase after this contract has been signed.</p><br><br><br>
		<h3>The final deed of purchase (Escritura)</h3>
		<p>⸻</p><br>
		<p>The final deed of purchase is signed at the notary's office.</p><br>
		<p>The balance of the purchase price is paid at this point, and the notary then enters the transaction in the official registers. Usually, the buyer can only take official possession after signing the final deeds to the property.</p><br>
		<p>Your solicitor can sign both the promise to purchase contract and the final deeds on your behalf, but only if he has first received your power of attorney, which it is advisable to do very early in the process to avoid having to travel to Portugal each time a signature is required. You can also sign both documents personally.</p><br>
		<p>The time between the promise contract and the signing of the final deeds may vary according to the wishes of the buyer and seller. This period is indicated in the promissory contract, but is generally between 30 and 60 days.</p><br>
		<p>You will have to pay before the final deeds are signed:</p><br>
		<p>IMT (Imposto Municipal Sobre as Tranmissões), a tax on property transactions, and Impôt de Selo.</p>
	</div>

			<br><h2>Before the contract</h2>
			<p>⸻</p><br><br><br>
			<p>Before paying any money or signing a forward contract, the buyer should ask his lawyer to undertake thorough pre-contractual investigations.</p><br>
			<p>A seller must have a full set of title deeds showing that the seller is the person legally authorised to sell and that the property being sold is the property that the buyer has agreed to buy.</p><br>
			<p>The property must have a valid housing licence showing that the local authority has approved the construction of the property.</p><br>
			<p>The buyer's legal representative will enquire about and verify the following:</p><br><br>
			<p><i>● Land registration</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Possession</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Title</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Description of the property</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Mortgages / Charges</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Related costs</i></p><br>
			<p><i>● Rights of pre-emption</i></p><br>

		<h4>Power of attorney</h4>
		<p>⸻</p><br>
		<p>Once you have found a lawyer who is right for you, we strongly recommend that you give him or her power of attorney. This allows your solicitor to request the necessary documents on your behalf and will save you many costs in the long run. Many property transactions have been lost because the buyer was unable to act quickly enough and this avoids this type of disappointment.</p><br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Documents required for the sale :</h3>
		<p>⸻</p><br><br>
		<h4>● Caderneta Predial</h4><br>
		<p>Every property must have a "Caderneta Predial". This is a tax identification document for the property that specifies, among other things, the taxable valuation. This valuation is important for determining the IMI tax (tax rate).</p><br><br>
		<h4>● Residential licence</h4><br>
		<p>All residential properties built after 1951 require a dwelling licence confirming that the local authority, Camara Municipal, has inspected the property and that it complies with planning permission and building regulations. If the property existed before 1951, a certificate stating this must also be obtained from the municipality.</p><br><br>
		<h4>● Tax number (Número de Contribuente)</h4><br>
		<p>If you are buying a property of any kind, you will need a tax number. The process is not complicated and can be managed by your solicitor.</p>

			<br><h2>After the final acts</h2>
			<p>⸻</p><br><br><br>
			<h3>Registration (Registo Predial)</h3><br><br>
			<p>Once the transaction has been recorded in the notary's archives, the lawyer will take a copy of the deed and register the transaction in the land register. This formally records the buyer's legal ownership of the property.</p><br>
			<p>It should be noted that the buyer is responsible for the deed of purchase drawn up by the notary.</p>
